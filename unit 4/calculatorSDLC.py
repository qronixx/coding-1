# Use the SDLC steps we learned to build a simplec alculator app.

# Ideate- what are some features we can implement into our calculator?

'1. User shouold be able to input calcute numbers. '
'2. User shuld be able to create different types of graphs (bar chart, scatter plot, etc.) '
'3. Conver values metric units into imperical units '

# Analysis and requirement- base on the code concepts we've learned, how can we make are ideas more tangible in code.
# - What data types do we need?
# - What operators showuld we use?
# - Do we need to use conditionals? or loops? or both?

'1. We wull need to use the interger and float data type to represent our number value we can use input to passin the data types into our program. '
'WE can use the arithmetic operator to do our calculations '
# - 1/5

'2. We culd use the comparion operators to make some of our graphing logic. We can install another python library to do the graphs for us. '
#  - 4/5
 
'3. We need to have the metric unit stored in a variable and then, do some aritmatic operation to convert the number and get the result '
#- 2.5/5

# - example

inch = 1 
foot = 12 # - roughly three feet in one meter
meter = 39.3701
