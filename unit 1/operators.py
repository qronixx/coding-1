# Operators
# perators are a construct (built-in system) that give datat types more actions anad power.

# Arithmetic family of operators (math)
# Arithmetic operators are just math operations
# arithmetic operators are the addition, and subtraction
# multiplication, and divison symobls

print(2+2)
print(3 * 10)
print(20 - 10)
print(3 / 1)
print(1.34 * 2)


print("Hello")

# print () is a funtion where anything inside the round brackets will be printed out in a terminal.

# assignment operator family
# these operators assign values to variables (otherwise known as containers)

x = "tyheem"
schoolName = "Boys Latin"

value1 = 10
value1 +=1
value1 -=2

print(x)
print(schoolName)
print(value1)

# comparison operator family
# comparison family of operators simply compares values

print(2 > 1)
print(100 < 29)
print("tyheem" == "tyheem") # double equal signs mean its comparing if the values are "THE SAME"

# logical operator family
# it checks and com pares fif certain code conditions are true or false

3 > 1 and print("tyheem" == "tyheem") # the AND operator checks to see if 1 condition is true. if 1 condition is true- then it will return true

# operator activity

studentA = 100
studentB = 90

print(studentA > studentB)

qb = 'jr'
wr1 = 'zay'
wr2 = 'cash'
te = 'ran'

print(qb)
print(wr1)

algebra = True
literature = True

algebra == True and literature == True

# OR means so long as 1 of te conditions is true it will return true
